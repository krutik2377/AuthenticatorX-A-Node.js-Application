[1] Fetch Changes from the Remote Repository:
Before pushing your changes, make sure you have the latest changes from the remote repository. Run the following commands:

bash
Copy code
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
The --allow-unrelated-histories flag allows Git to merge unrelated histories.

So here first i have created my project and then i have created repo and added 1 readme file and did commit now i just add remote repo and when i try to push the my project , there is clash happening.
After using this command it will fetch all the remote work and do merge with your project then your can push the changes to your repo.
